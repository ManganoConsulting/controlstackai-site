This patch includes a lightweight placeholder hero graphic:

For production, replace it with your preferred artwork (AVIF/WebP recommended), keeping the same filename or updating the <img> src.

Suggested directions:
- Abstract 3D mesh or network (teal/violet on dark)
- Macro PCB/lines imagery
- Lightfield particles

Remember to credit photographers if you import from Unsplash/Pexels.
